* Rebuild

A convenience program for rebuilding on NixOS.

** Features

*Multiple profiles*: each time you run this program, you must specify a profile, unless there is a default one saved (to save one, specify it, and pass the ~-s~ / ~--save-default~ flag with it). The rest of the flags only have to be specified, if you want to use flags different from the ones saved for that profile. If you specify a different value for a flag from what is saved, the saved value will be automatically updated.

*Remote deployment*: profiles may have a remote set. In which case the built configuration will be activated on that remote, instead of locally.

** Building / Running

To build, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build main.go
#+END_SRC

then run the resulting executable file, or run directly with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go run main.go
#+END_SRC
